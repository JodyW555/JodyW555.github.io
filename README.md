# About Me
I am a fully qualified Medical Laboratory Scientist.  Unfortunately (or fortunately) that career fell through, after I had a baby into Covid lockdown and realised that it was a very non-family friendly job.  The hours were horrific 24:7 cover more than 55 hours a week, the pay not worth it - I was stuck on Step 9 pay scale for my last 10+ years, and very high risk for Covid-19 infection.
So after a short break, I returned to fulltime study, studying IT.  IT is something I have always had a passion for, having been programming and writing programs since my pre-teens, and being the informal go-to person at my old job for any IT problems.  So it was the logical choice.  I quickly found a course at my local EIT.  I began by doing the NZ Certificate in IT Essentials, an introductory course as I hadn't studied for quite some time.  I passed that with straight A+ marks, confirmation for me that I was now on the correct path.  I have never got straight A's for anything in my life.  So then I went on to complete NZ Certificate in IT, and again I got great marks, despite being sick a lot with a son in daycare picking up all the bugs, topped off by Covid for the first time as I was finishing my final exams and assignments.  Then I discovered I had completed one semester of the degree, so I thought why not?
