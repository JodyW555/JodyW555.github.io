					<p>
						I was born and bred in Feilding, a small town of around 14,000 people in the lower North Island
						of New Zealand. I am the second eldest child of four, and the only daughter.
					</p>
					<p>My hobbies include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Reading - mostly science fiction and fantasy, Kate Atkinson, Sara Douglass, Juliet
							Marillier, Joanne Harris, and The Hungry Little Caterpillar!
						</li>
						<li>Watching TV - Supernatural, Doctor Who, Crime Mysteries, British Comedies mainly</li>
						<li>Movies - Star Wars, Studio Ghibli, Amelie, The English Patient, The Princess Bride</li>
						<li>
							Gaming - Mostly Adventure Games like Forever Lost and Syberia, and RPG such as Final Fantasy
							VII
						</li>
						<li>Learning Languages</li>
						<li>Cryptic crossword puzzles</li>
						<li>Cooking and Baking</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I finished high school at age 17 knowing exactly what I wanted to do. I then completed the BMLS
						(Medical Laboratory Science) degree at Massey University. After this, I gained a job as a
						medical Laboratory scientist at Gisborne Hospital, the city where my mother was born and raised,
						and our family history dates back to the 1800s with the arrival of my great-great-great
						grandparents on a ship from Cornwall, so it made sense. I worked at Gisborne Hospital for at
						least 15 years, and perhaps a few more.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then in 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, and I had a baby a few hours before the first nationwide
						lockdown. This required me to completely rethink my career trajectory I had been on since sixth
						form at high school, due to the hours being pretty horrific and high risk for catching Covid-19.
						I had always been talented with computers, having been writing my own programs since my
						pre-teens, starting with Basic and Turtle Basic (vector drawing) on the family's Amstrad CPC-664
						computer. So it was logical to pick a new career path that would lead to me doing something I
						loved, and which would lend itself to more flexible & family friendly hours. I also desperately
						needed some mental stimulation. A kaiawhina that had been visiting us regularly since my son was
						born, accompanied me to check out IT courses at EIT. After much deliberation I decided to enrol
						in the Level 4 NZ Certificate in IT Essentials starting January 2022. I loved it so much, a few
						weeks after it started I enrolled in the Level 5 NZ Certificate in IT. Being spontaneous for the
						first time in my life. Near the end of that, I found out I had completed part of the BCS degree,
						so I decided it was now or never and I took a leap and re-enrolled. I'm looking to carve a new
						career for myself, or at least a decent side-hustle. In the future I see myself as being a
						programmer ultimately in the gaming industry.

					<h1>Web Technologies</h1>
					<p>My top 5 web technologies I use:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Web Design:
							<p>
								I would consider my level of Web Design to be intermediate. I learnt some basic HTML and
								Java 2 years ago, and coded a basic website using only HTML. Since then I have updated
								and broadened my skills and written two websites for Level 4 and Level 5 courses, using
								a mix of HTML 5, CSS and Javascript.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Google Forms:
							<p>
								I am intermediate level for this. We used Google Forms to create user feedback surveys
								in both Level 4 and Level 5 courses, and it is fairly straightforward to me now to
								create a range of questions using various structures.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Diagrams.net:
							<p>
								I have used this software extensively to create mainly flowcharts, organisational
								structure diagrams and ERDs since Level 4.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Lucid Chart:
							<p>
								I am beginner level for this software which I began using this semester (2023 semester
								2) for my DBMS class to create a high level ERD. I am about to use it again to create a
								fully attributed ERD as it seems more user friendly than Diagrams.net that I have used
								up until now.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Bootstrap 5:
							<p>
								I began using this technology only this semester (2023 semester 2) so I would consider
								myself as a beginner. There is still a lot for me to learn with regards to Bootstrap.
							</p>
						</li>

								<h2>HTML:5</h2>
								<p>
